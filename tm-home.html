    <h1>Timed</h1>
    <div>
    <p>In this mode there is a timer constantly going down until it reaches 0.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to hit as many targets as you can before the time runs out.</p>
    <p>There will always be 3 targets on the screen at a time so you will always be able to see the next target that you
        can hit.</p>
    <p>When the time runs out the game will end and you will be able to see your score.</p>
