    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>
        <p>This website is a fun simple aim trainer coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by a beginner.</p>
        <p>The timer is bugged and starts 2 seconds late and then ends 2 seconds early.</p>
        <p>My best score for timed is 57 and speedrun is 27 seconds. See if you can beat it. Keep in mind that your
            score will not be saved.</p>
        <p>Try to have fun and maybe even improve your aim!</p>
