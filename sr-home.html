    <h1>Speedrun</h1>
    <div>
        <p>In this mode there is a timer that starts at 0 and constantly goes up until the game is finished.</p>
        <p>Your goal is to hit 50 targets as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>There will always be 3 targets on the screen at a time so you will always be able to see the next target that
            you can hit.</p>
        <p>When you hit 50 targets the game will stop and you will be able to see your time.</p>
